# arduino-nodejs-angularjs-socket.io3


The idea from this project is to present the ability to use arduino board (UNO R3 in this example) as a data capture device (in our case reading temperature), then presenting the captrued data on PC.

## The project consist of three parts:

###### Hardware part:
The circuit is very simple, I used LM35 as temperature detector as shown in the photo:

I also installed [Standara Firmata](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Installing-Standard-Firmata/). Firmata is a protocol (set of rules) for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a computer, smartphone, or tablet. Standard Firmata is a software library that allows Arduino devices to communicate with your computer using the Firmata protocol. 

###### NODEJS part:
